There are no direct resources available when it comes to machine coding, one of widley popular interview rounds these days in a lot of companies. 
This is a curated list of projects that I worked on for the Low Level System Design/ Machine Coding round. 
There is no right and wrong solution to these problems. 
There are my solutions. Would love and appreciate any feedback. 

The general idea that I followed to approach these problems is -

1. List down all the features you want to support as a part of your solution. This helps a lot narrowing and defining your scope. 
2. Based on the requirements you listed in step 1, start creating entities/models, that you will be working off of. 
3. Start working on one API at a time, and you can follow top-down / bottoms-up approach. Start from repsoitory and end at Controller. Start at Controller end at repository. Usually the latter works best in case of complicated APIs.
